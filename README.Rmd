Cubature is an R package for adaptive multivariate integration over
hypercubes using deterministic and Monte Carlo methods. The package
provides wrappers around two C libraries:

- The cubature C library  of [Steven G. Johnson](https://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/)
- The Cuba C library of [Thomas Hahn](https://wwwth.mpp.mpg.de/members/hahn/)

Both scalar and vectorized interfaces are available for all
routines. R users will gain a lot by using the vectorization as
demonstrated in the included vignette.
