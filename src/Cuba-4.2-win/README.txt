The contents of this directory are the changes I made to Cuba-4.2
library to get it to compile under Windows using Rtools toolchain.
The changes are quite minor.

This organization allows me to ensure that the Cuba-4.2 tree remains
untouched.

The Makevars.win file in package src directory file copies these
changed files to the Cuba-4.2 tree before compilation.
